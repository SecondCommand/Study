SQL vs NoSQL:
1. Key-value model—the least complex NoSQL option, which 
stores data in a schema-less way that consists of indexed 
keys and values. Examples: Cassandra, Azure, LevelDB, and Riak.

2. Column store—or, wide-column store, which stores data tables
 as columns rather than rows. It’s more than just an inverted 
 table—sectioning out columns allows for excellent scalability 
 and high performance. Examples: HBase, BigTable, HyperTable.
3. Document database—taking the key-value concept and adding 
more complexity, each document in this type of database has 
its own data, and its own unique key, which is used to retrieve
 it. It’s a great option for storing, retrieving and managing 
 data that’s document-oriented but still somewhat structured. 
 Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.
4. Graph database—have data that’s interconnected and best
 represented as a graph? This method is capable of lots of 
 complexity. Examples: Polyglot, Neo4J.
