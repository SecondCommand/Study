SQL vs NoSQL
* Columnar databases, for dealing with massive collections 
of simple structured data, such as log files. Google, for 
its part, has Bigtable: a distributed, column-oriented data
 store to handle structured data associated with the company's
  Internet search and Web services operations, including Web 
  indexing, MapReduce, Google Maps, Google Book Search, "My 
  Search History," Google Earth, Blogger.com, Google Code hosting, YouTube, and Gmail.

* Key-value and other unstructured databases such as MongoDB, 
which use rules defined by programmers to comb through large 
amounts of unstructured data, including documents and websites.

* High-speed databases for processing large streams of data 
with extremely low latency. Those diverging tasks have driven
 the evolution of some very different technologies that often 
 get lumped together as NoSQL, and some that are labeled as 
 "NewSQL." These provide some of the things that SQL-based
  relational databases do but are tuned heavily for handling the 
  demands of big data. VoltDB falls into this category: it's a 
  high-speed SQL database. Couchbase is another high-speed, more 
  general-purpose, NoSQL database.
