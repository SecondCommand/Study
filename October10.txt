500 Internal Server Error
The server encountered an unexpected 
condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

409 Conflict
The request could not be completed 
due to a conflict with the current state of the resource. 
This code is only allowed in situations where it is expected 
that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit
 the request. The response body SHOULD include enough information
  for the user to recognize the source of the conflict. Ideally, the response entity would include enough information for the user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be possible and is not required.
Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request.
 For example, if versioning were being used and the entity being
  PUT included changes to a resource which conflict with those made
   by an earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409
    response to indicate that it can't complete the request. In this
     case, the response entity would likely contain a list of the 
     differences between the two versions in a format defined by the 
     response Content-Type.

404 
Not Found The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally configurable mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding address. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response is applicable.
